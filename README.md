### *The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. Working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.*

## STL has 4 components :
- **Algorithms**
- **Containers**
- **Functions**
- **Iterators**

## Multisets
### A multiset is an STL container that can contain multiple objects which have the same value which is stored in a well-defined manner. The multisets are almost similar to multisets, except in multisets only unique elements are allowed but in multisets, multiple elements with the same values are also allowed.

## *How to use multisets in C++ ??*

- **The STL multisets can be used in the program by adding two header files.**
- **The first is a *set* and the other is an *iterator.***
